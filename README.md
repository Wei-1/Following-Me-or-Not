# Following Me or Not

There are people on Github who follows a lot of people and will unfollow you if you follow them back.

This is a simple page for me to track that.

For those who will want to use this without forking the repo,
you can modify the uid in the page params:

```
?uid=Wei-1
```


## Note

Sometime the `api.github.com` doesn't provide a valid response...

You should just refresh the page.


## Another Note

I had added `pagination` into the code based on:

https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination

For those with a lot of followers/ing, it will take some time for everyone in all pages to be loaded.
