# Following Me or Not

There are people on Github who follows a lot of people and will unfollow you if you follow them back.

This is a simple page for me to track that.

For those who will want to use this without forking the repo,
you can modify the uid in the page params:

```
?uid=Wei-1
```

## Note

For those who has followers/ing more than 100 people, you need to modify the `pagination` as described in this page:

https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination

Since I don't have that much followers/ing, I am too lazy to make the change. (PRs are welcome though).
